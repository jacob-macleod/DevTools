# DevTools

## What is this?

A collection of random tools and programs, mostly made with ChatGPT

## How do I access this?

You can view the deployed site at `https://storage.googleapis.com/devtools-bucket/index.html`

## Next steps

I may add new programs to the site. In addition, I may add a CI/CD pipeline to automatically update the bucket with terraform when a change is made
